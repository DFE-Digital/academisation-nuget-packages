# Extension Methods

## What does this do ?
This package includes a set of extension methods useful throughout the DfE Academisation process, but generic enough to not belong to any one solution.

## Why does it do it ?
By packaging the extension methods we hope to make them useful to other developers and have one place where we may add new functionality and fix any issues

## How to use it 

1) Install the package.
2) Import the Dfe.Academisation.Extension methods namespace wherever you need to use one of the extensions.
3) Call the extension methods you need.
